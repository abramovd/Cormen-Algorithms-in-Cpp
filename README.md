# C++ implementation of the well-known algorithms

## Based on the  Introduction to algorithms, 3rd Edition: Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.

## List of currently implemented algorithms:

* MaxSubArray
* MergeSort
* HeapSort
* MaxPriorQueue
* QuickSort
* CountingSort
* RadixSort

## How to run

In order to run these algorithms you need to clone this to you hard drive and then run it with GCC 4.2 or further. For example, in order to run QuickSort.cpp on Mac or Linux you should do the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/abramovd/Cormen-Algorithms-in-Cpp.git
g++ -o a.out QuickSort.cpp
./a.out
```
